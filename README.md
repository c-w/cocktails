## What's this?

This blog is a space for me to collect tasty cocktail recipes that I've prepared
and make them easily searchable for the future.

The frontend for the blog is hosted on [gh-pages](https://justamouse.com/cocktails-blog/).
It's built using ReactJS and SemanticUI and pulls data from this repository.

## Recipes schema

```json
[
  {
    "Rating": "integer",
    "Name": "string",
    "Ingredients": "string"
  }
]
